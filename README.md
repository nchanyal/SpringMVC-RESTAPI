# Runnerz REST API 

This is a REST API that takes HTTP requests related to creating, reading, updating, and deleting runs. 

The UI provided by Swagger gives users a visual representation of carrying out CRUD operations. 

## The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
 - Java
 - Spring Boot
 - Building a REST API

### Specifically, I used the following:
 - Spring MVC
 - Spring Boot Annotations (@Component / RestController / Repository)
 - REST API Testing (Postman)
 - Dependency injection
 - Data Validation
 - JDBC Client
 - Docker Compose & PostgreSQL
 - HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, status codes)
